# Elastic-Weight-Consolidation-for-Continual-Learning

Developed and implemented a Simple Neural Network (NN) with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for continual learning using PyTorch. Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of model performance on Fashion-MNIST, achieving an average accuracy of 90.55% with zero forgetting. Analyzed forward transfer, highlighting a -10.38% transfer effect across tasks. Improved learning efficiency through adaptive learning rate scheduling.
